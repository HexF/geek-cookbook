# Matomo

[Matomo](http://www.matomo.org) (Formally known as piwik) is a rich open-source web analytics platform, which can be coupled with commercial plugins for additional features. It's most simply described as "_self-hosted Google Analytics_".

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik) configured per design


## Preparation

### Limitation of docker-swarm

The docker-swarm load-balancer is a problem for deploying Matomo, since it rewrites the source address of every incoming packet to whichever docker node received the packet into the swarm. Which is a PITA for analytics, since the original source IP of the request is obscured.

The issue is tracked at #[25526](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25526), and there is a workaround, but it requires running the Matomo "app" container on **every** swarm node...

### Prepare environment

Create Matomo.env, and populate with the following variables

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=set-me-and-use-me-when-setting-up-Matomo
```

### Setup docker swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [patreon patrons](https://www.patreon.com/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that patrons can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç

```

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.


## Serving

Launch the Piwik stack by running ```docker stack deploy piwik -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**, and follow the wizard to complete the setup.
